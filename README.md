The Batteries-Included Flask-based Framework.

Biffy is a web framework based on Flask, good intentions,
but mostly laziness. The desire here is to create a boilerplate-esque
application that will handle pretty much the base line requirements of any
modern day web application. This includes, but is not limited to:

* User authentication with social services (Google, Facebook, Twitter)
* Posting of application updates to social accounts
* Clean look and feel (courtesy of Twitter Bootstrap)
* Easy to develop and extend
* Mobile ready (responsive design)
* An easy to use platform for even the novice developer
