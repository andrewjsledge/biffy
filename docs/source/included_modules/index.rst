Included Modules
================

This is the “Batteries-Included” part of Biffy. A good web framework should be
able to get you up and running with some sort of base functionality right out
of the box. Planned blueprints include a blog, a contact form, a twitter client,
a facebook client, a calendar, and maybe a few more.
