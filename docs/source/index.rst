   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Biffy: The Batteries-Included Flask-based Framework's documentation!
===============================================================================

The Batteries Included Flask-based Framework.

Biffy is a web framework based on Flask, good intentions,
but mostly laziness. The desire here is to create a boilerplate-esque
application that will handle pretty much the base line requirements of any
modern day web application. This includes, but is not limited to:

* User authentication with social services (Google, Facebook, Twitter)
* Posting of application updates to social accounts
* Clean look and feel
* Easy to use
* Mobile ready
* An easy to use platform for even the novice developer
